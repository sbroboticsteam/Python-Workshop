# Python-Workshop
Example code used in the Robotics + Python Workshop

Python libraries used: pysdl2, pySerial, numpy

To install these libraries, run pip install [library_name]

For sdl2, you will also need to get the sdl2 binaries, which can be installed 
on Ubuntu by running sudo apt install libsdl2-dev. On Windows, download the 
DLL and keep it in the same folder as the joystick code. You may have to 
export an environment variable in order for Python to see the DLL.
